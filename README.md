# beta-bank-churn
This project's objective was to predict if a bank customer will leave the bank of not, based on information about them. Once trained, my objective is to determine which model is best for the job and use it. Since the desired result is to predict whether or not someone leaves or stays, this is a matter of classification. Therefore, the models will be of the classifier type.

This project, particularly, required me to impliment a lot of supervised learning tactics suh as upsampling, downsampling, and scaling to improve the quality of the models.
